**YEAR_1:**
[What happens after 1 year? Include emotional texture: fears, growth, changes in relationships, mental health, fulfillment, surprises. Be honest, not overly idealistic. Write 2-3 paragraphs.]

**YEAR_3:**
[Where are they at year 3? Show progression, new challenges, deeper changes. Include career development, relationship evolution, personal growth. Write 2-3 paragraphs.]

**YEAR_10:**
[How has life changed at year 10? Show the long-term transformation, wisdom gained, legacy building. Include reflections on the journey. Write 2-3 paragraphs.]

**FUTURE_MESSAGE:**
[A single powerful message from that future self to the present self. One compelling sentence that captures the essence of this path. Format: "Here's what I'd tell you now: ..." Keep it under 50 words.]

Guidelines:
- Write in first person ("I" perspective)
- Be realistic and nuanced, not overly optimistic
- Include both challenges and rewards
- Show emotional and psychological development
- Consider practical aspects like finances, relationships, location
- Make it personal and relatable
- Keep each section focused and engaging

IMPORTANT: Use the exact format markers **YEAR_1:**, **YEAR_3:**, **YEAR_10:**, and **FUTURE_MESSAGE:** so the response can be properly parsed.`;

**YEAR_3:**
[Where are they at year 3 of the current path? Show steady progression, deeper roots in current situation, accumulated experience and relationships. Include both the stability gained and any dreams deferred. Write 2-3 paragraphs.]

**YEAR_10:**
[How has life evolved at year 10 on the current path? Show the mature version of their current life, achievements within their existing framework, wisdom and security gained. Include honest reflection on roads not taken and paths chosen. Write 2-3 paragraphs.]

**FUTURE_MESSAGE:**
[A message from that future self about the current path chosen. Something that acknowledges both the value of stability and any lingering curiosity about alternatives. Format: "Here's what I'd tell you now: ..." Keep it under 50 words.]

Guidelines:
- Write in first person ("I" perspective)
- Be realistic about natural career/life progression
- Include both contentment and occasional restlessness
- Show the value of stability and consistency
- Include personal growth within their current framework
- Consider relationships deepening over time
- Balance satisfaction with honest "what if" moments
- Make it personal and relatable
