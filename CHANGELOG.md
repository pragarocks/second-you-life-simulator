## Version 2.0.0 - AI-Powered Dual Path Simulation (Latest)

### üöÄ Major Features

#### **Fully AI-Generated Current Path**
- **Before**: Hardcoded, generic "current path" responses
- **After**: AI generates personalized current path simulation based on your unique profile
- **Impact**: Both paths are now equally detailed, realistic, and tailored to you

#### **Parallel AI Generation**
- Both current and alternate paths generated simultaneously for efficiency
- Reduced API calls while providing twice the content
- Enhanced comparison quality with matched narrative depth

#### **Enhanced Comparison View**
- Side-by-side AI-generated life paths
- Automatic insight extraction from AI content
- Intelligent highlighting of key themes (growth, relationships, finances)
- Visual path differentiation with color coding

#### **Dual Future Messages**
- Message from your future self on the current path
- Message from your future self on the alternate path
- Direct comparison of both life philosophies

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### **Backend Enhancements**
- New `generateCurrentPath()` method with tailored prompts
- Parallel processing with `Promise.all()` for efficiency
- Enhanced error handling for dual-path generation
- Updated response structure: `{ alternatePath, currentPath, metadata }`

#### **Frontend Updates**
- Complete rewrite of `ComparisonView` component
- Dynamic insight extraction from AI content
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability
- Environment-aware API configuration

#### **New Prompt Engineering**
- **Current Path Prompt**: Focuses on realistic progression, "what if" moments, and honest reflection on stability vs. adventure
- **Alternate Path Prompt**: Enhanced with emotional texture and practical considerations
- Both prompts designed for balanced, nuanced narratives

### üìä User Experience

#### **More Realistic Comparisons**
- No more generic "you stay in your job" responses
- AI considers your specific traits, location, profession, and age
- Honest portrayal of both contentment and restlessness in current path
- Balanced view of both stability and adventure

#### **Richer Insights**
- Automatic theme detection in AI responses
- Key characteristic summaries for each path
- Philosophical insights from both future selves
- Better decision-making support

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Features

#### **Git & Deployment Ready**
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` and environment templates
- Multi-platform deployment configurations (Vercel, Render, Railway)
- Root `package.json` for workspace management
- Automated setup scripts (`setup-git.bat`)

#### **Documentation**
- `GIT_SETUP.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `USER_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive user instructions
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Command cheat sheet
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file
